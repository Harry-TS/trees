    <br>
    Walk up to a tree, or tap it on the map, to identify it.<br>
    <br>
    Tap the button in the lower right corner of the map to center it on your location,
    and again to also orient the map to your current heading.<br>
    <br>
    Tree data comes from databases made publicly available by each city, and typically 
    contains trees on city land, such as parks, sidewalks, and median strips.<br>
    <br>
